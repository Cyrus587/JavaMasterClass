formate to a for loop 

for(init; termination; increment){
}

init- the code is going to be initialized once at the beggining of the loop 
termination- condition is put here once it becomes false the code stops exicuting 
increment- how many time the loop is exicuted before it stops 

example 
for(int i=0; i<5; i++) { 
            System.out.println("Loop " + i + " hello!");

int (variable name usually i =0 because we are starting at zero); condition while i< 5; incrementation continue adding one to the value of the variable i (i++)

this loop will run four times because 4 is the last number that is less than i then it stops 

if you start at i=1 it will run one less becuase it started at one more than 


for(int =2; i<9; i++){ becuase we are going up to the number 8 we need to iterate to when i is less than 9 becuase 8 is the last number that is less than 9 
System.out.println("10,000 at"+ i +" % intrest = "+ calculateIntrest(10000, i));
}


becuase we are going up to the number 8 we need to iterate to when i is less than 9 becuase 8 is the last number that is less than 9... might have to cast the variable to a different type when you call the method and but i as a parameter

 for(int =8; i>=2; i--){	
	System.out.println("10,000 at"+ i +" % intrest = "+ calculateIntrest(10000, i));
}

here you need to do i >= 2 becuase the code will terminate when it reaches two.

public static boolean rangeOfNumber(int num){
	if(isPrime(n)==true){
	for(int num = 0; num<= 10; num++){
	return true;
	}
	}else{
		break;
	}
	}
}



need a count so do to keep track of how many time it iterates threw the loop 

int count = 0;
for(int i =10; i <50; i++){
	if(isPrime(i)){
		count++;
		System.out.println("Number"+ i+ "is a prime number");
		System.out.println("Exiting for loop");
		break;
	}
	}

}


for statemnet recap 

for( int num = 1; num < 0; num += 2){
	System.out.println("number= " + number);
this statement will never exicute 
the increment in this for loop is by twos 

will sometimes have an infinite loop 
for examplpe 
for (int number= 100; number < 0; number += 10)

sum and three and kfive challange
