I was wondering if I could get your opinion on three classes I am considering for the spring semester.  I’m on the BA track with a minor in Accounting. I need to choose one ( of my required 4 ) CS electives.  I am thinking about and looking at the details of the following classes : CS 309, CS 332, CS 355 and CS 380.  I do know that one of my 4 elective choices needs to be a  400 level course but I am not ready to choose that class right now.  I am leaning toward CS 309 and CS 355 because they both sound interesting and I think Mathmatica would be an interesting language to learn.  I am struggling a bit with the details of CS 332 or CS 380 and how they would help me. To be honest, I have not chosen a specific position to pursue after graduation, but it’s unlikely to be systems programming..  
Could we meet on Zoom and would you be willing to tell me about these classes and offer some advice so I can make a good decision on my electives, I was also wondering if there was any
