 int switchValue = 6;    define a switch value 

        switch (switchValue) { 
            case 1: //start with the key word "case" the number you are dealing with a colon so 
                System.out.println("Value was 1");
                break;


the format is switch(switch value defined) {
		case (whitch case you are dealing with):
			//code exicuted for that case 
		break;
		
		default:
			//code to be exicuted otherwise... this is like an else statement 
		
break means that it will just exicute the rest of the code that you should be using

can either use a switch statement or an if statement. would use if you are testing different values for a certain variable for example switch( variable)... but you can change the value of the variable 
can write the code out in an abbreviated way like this 

 	    case 3:
            case 4:
            case 5:
                System.out.println("was a 3 or a 4, or a 5");     
                System.out.println("Actually it was a " + switchValue);
                break;

must have break key word will just continue on if there is no break statement 
(common error) 

but all the switch statements are in the brackets 

Challange 

can create a switch statement from a string 
for example 
      String month = "JuNE";
        switch (month.toUpperCase()) {
            case "JANUARY":
                System.out.println("Jan");
                break;
            case "JUNE":
                System.out.println("Jun");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Not sure");
        }


    }
}


if you misspell something you can do toLower() method will change the all the strings charectors to lower case
you can also do this for to upper case 
example


      String month = "JuNE";
        switch (month.toUpperCase()) {   // THE method is right here 
            case "JANUARY":
                System.out.println("Jan");
                break;
            case "JUNE":
                System.out.println("Jun");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Not sure");
        }


    }
}

If you want your code to run for all the methods you need a main method public static void main(String args[])

to test the method you wrote make a call to the method from within the main method see Day of the week challange.
