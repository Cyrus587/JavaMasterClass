formate of a while loop is 

public static void main(String [] args ){
	int count = 1;
	while(count !=6){
		System.out.println("the count value is" + count);
		count++;
	}

	
}

can also write this while loop like this 
	count = 1;
	while(true){
	if(count==6){
		break;
	}
		System.out.println("Count value is" + count);
		count++;
	}
	
	
	


we have to create

an equivilant statement in for the for loop is 
for(int i=1; i<7; i++){
	System.out.println("Count value is" + count);



sometimes we want to evaluate an expression until it reaches false this is a while loop 

public static void main(String [] args ){
	int count = 1;
	while(count !=6){
		System.out.println("the count value is" + count);
		count++;
	}

	
}

can write like 
this as this will evaluate until false 
count = 1;
while (true) {
            if (num == 6) {   //this is the same way to write the for loop just using a while loop
                break;
            }
            System.out.println("count value is using while true while loop " + num);
            num++;

NEED TO HAVE THE VARIABLE INCREMENTED VARIABLE ++;


Coninue - By pass print statement starts on the next number and goes through the code again


recap 

while(conditon){
//statemens 
}
this is syntax 

if we need to increment a variable we do inside while loop but define varibles outside of while loop 

do
	// statements 
}while (condition){

code exicutes once and then the condition is checked 


the do while is exicuted at least once 

the while loop is checks the code before it exicutes the code 

easy to get caught in an endless loop 

can interupt look with continue break 

break will exit the loop continue will skip the section below it and go back to top of code and run again
